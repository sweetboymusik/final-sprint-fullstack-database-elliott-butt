Final Sprint for Full-Stack and Database
Elliott BUtt

1. Quite a while, as it was a solo effort. Hard to tell the number of hours,
   but I worked on it for at least 1 whole week of the 2 given (the other being
   for the other project)
2. ChatGPT, google, stackoverflow, postgres docs, mongo docs, npm docs (mainly for passport)
3. No additional help from teachers.
3. No additional help from friends.
5. I would say it was a good difficulty. Made me work hard, but never felt too overwhelming.
   Learned a lot!

NOTES:

I left the .env out of the .gitignore so that the project would work properly if downloaded to
your system. I realize this is bad practice, as .env files should be protected!
